Private messages that wipe after 7 days

We forked Messengyr last night:

https://github.com/Microflow/messengyr

## 2 Key Features

Messages will wipe after 7 days. Saves us database space. Gives more privacy to the user.
We'll work hard on the CSS and make some beautiful UI's, like Slack did for IRC. Codepenners welcome. Right now, we need more JS and CSS people than Elixir. The back-end code is simple but solid.

I don't want to use any external, corporate APIs from FB, Amazon or Google if possible. We'll tell our user their messages are private. We can look at encryption later.

## Submission Guidelines

No docs yet, but please ask before using a framework. Vue JS and Mithril are welcome for now. Vanilla JS and HTML is fine as well. Would prefer not to use React JS or any other big tech framework. Keep the web independent.

We're looking for kind, cooperative people. Everyone's welcome. Beginners can help research codepens, APIs and help write docs.

We'll communicate on this thread, or Github issues.
